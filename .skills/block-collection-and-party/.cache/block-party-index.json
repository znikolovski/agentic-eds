The moment they publish, based on the dates they mention in the dates metadata - that event will pop up to that particular date. \n2) We do have Monthly, weekly, daily & List views available.\n3) Recurring meetings are also very much taken care in this implementation along with excluding any dates within. We do have Monthly, weekly, daily & List views available.\n4) Departments can select their individual calendar items - which will route them to their individual calendar page. \n5) We can also search of any event and it will display those set of events.\n6) We have also empowered the site Admins to select any important events from that whole set of events with which they can raise money, via enabling a \"featured\" flag.
